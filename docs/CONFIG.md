# Config - yviel's FSA FSA_VERSION_STRING
Configuration is what it's all about: setting up various services to do various things.

Every machine you control with FSA gets its own configuration file right here.

See [the roles directory](../roles/) for more information on how that works.

More examples can be found in the roles' individual subdirectories, aswell as in the [test scenarios](../molecule/) used to automatically test FSA.

[See here](../docs/FSA_CMD.md) on information on how to apply this configuration.
